                Peter Schiff is an American stockbroker and financial
                commentator known as an outspoken opponent of cryptocurrency
                such as Bitcoin. A popular Twitter meme shows this fact by
                showing Bitcoin has seen massive price appreciation from $1 to
                nearly $9,000. Nonetheless, his sentiment on gold price
                stability echoed this claim perfectly; proof positive of it
                staying stable over the same timeframe.
                <br />
                <br />
                Simply stated, gold is among the safest assets to own in terms
                of long-term stability, making it a fantastic place to keep
                savings safe over the coming years. Currency debasement and
                large scale financial collapse have occurred time after time in
                history; therefore it would be prudent for people in such times
                to protect their savings in gold instead of fiat money bank
                accounts.

                Gold-backed cryptocurrency: the perfect combination of physical
                assets and digital investments
                <br />
                <br /> Blockchain technology makes owning gold easier than ever
                with digital tokens like Pax Gold (PAXG), offering legal titles
                to real gold securely embedded within digital tokens that anyone
                who purchases one receives the following:
                <br />
                <br />
                1) Quick and cost-effective gold transactions across borders
                <br /> 2) Direct Access to Real Gold Prices <br /> 3) Access and
                cost efficiency of traditional financial assets.
                <br />
                <br />
                At one time, the difficulties associated with buying,
                transporting and storing physical gold deterred many from
                exploring this option - effectively missing out on its many
                advantages as an investor. Now with stablecoins such as PAXG
                available to them however, investors gain all these advantages
                without incurring unnecessary effort in their ownership of
                precious metals.
                <br />
                <br />
                Gold provides an incredible opportunity for digital asset
                enthusiasts and traders alike. If you would like to open up a
                PAXG savings account and start earning digital gold today,
